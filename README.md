# How To Test

1. In order to test HomeWork 1 part 1 you should run MyLList.java and Driver.java in the SRC folder(Not in the arraylistwithiterator folder). You can run MyLList.java and Driver.java from the arraylistwithiterator folder but you have to compile using the path to the file, e.g. javac arraylistwithiterator/MyLList.java or javac arraylistwithiterator/Driver.java.<br>

2. In order to test HomeWork 1 part 2 you should run ExpressionEvaluator.java in the SRC folder(Not in the arraylistwithiterator folder).
